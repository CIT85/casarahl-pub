#  Financially Break those habits 

- My topic I have selected was ways to help you become for financially stable. The reason I selected this topic was because I am very good at managing and budgeting my money. I want to teach and show people they can too. Usually people who tend to have issues with budgeting money are just being inpulsive with it or might be struggling. I can teach them how to stretch a dollar and turn one dollar into two in my website. In this prompt I will go over ways that will help you.

## Everything that will be covered in my website 

1. manage your money better
2. Get out of debt 
3. Ways to save 
4. Ways to budget your money 
5. examples of people with bad money habits 
6. example of people fixing thier money habits to better.
 
- those are all the tobic and things I will be going over in my website. 


### Using Flexbox

- The first thing I did was put a row and column over all my text 
- Then I went into my css and added the flexbox to my css
- I started adding the background color and  
  1. display: flex;
   2. flex-direction: column;
    3. background-color:;
    4. flex-wrap: wrap;
    5. border: 2px solid white
- After that I commited my work.
