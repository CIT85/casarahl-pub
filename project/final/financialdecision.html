    <h2 class="row">Process</h2>
    <p class="column">
        The process of financial decision-making involves several key steps aimed at achieving financial goals and managing resources effectively. It begins with identifying financial objectives, which may include saving for retirement, purchasing a home, or funding education. Once goals are established, individuals or businesses gather relevant information and assess their financial situation, taking into account income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Next, they explore available options and evaluate the potential risks and returns associated with each alternative. After careful analysis, a decision is made, and an action plan is implemented. However, the process doesn't end there; it requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment to adapt to changing circumstances and optimize outcomes. Effective financial decision-making entails a combination of critical thinking, financial literacy, and a strategic approach to managing resources wisely.</p>
