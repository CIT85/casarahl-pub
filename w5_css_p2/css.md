how position works?

fixed position if you scroll it will stay in one position the whole time and will never move

Sticky allow content to stay in place and allow you to add links

it always First is flex-direction and then flex-wrap and after flex-flow 

use these three element to center  
 display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;


  clicking {control+D} will select one content and another and you can change them both at the same time.
