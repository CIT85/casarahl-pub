 - An img is an inline element is it will allow a space with paragraphs or text. 
-  If you want to remove the space you will use img { display:block} it will wrap down to the next line and move your text. 



  ## The background size pther size but its recommanded is cover or contain. 
 - contain will repeat the image but if you put no repeat it will use the cover and back ground color too.

   - and always use a image twice as big as what youre planning on displaying. 
  -  linear gradient is an image top to bottom 
  -  radial gradient is in the middle and exapands out.
