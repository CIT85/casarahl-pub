 First you have to give it a heigh and width by doing that you are reserving that space.
 When  its givin a percentage width and height responive as "auto" it will make the image responsive.
 An img is an inline element is it will allow a space with paragraphs or text. 
 If you want to remove the space you will use img { display:block} it will wrap down to the next line and move your text. 



  The background size pther size but its recommanded is cover or contain. 
  contain will repeat the image but if you put no repeat it will use the cover and back ground color too.
  You should shrink image down and be careful because some images use pixels and it might be blurryb
   and always use a image twice as big as what youre planning on displaying. 


What does dave mean by fallback?
