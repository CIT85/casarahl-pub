 First you have to give it a heigh and width by doing that you are reserving that space.
 When  its givin a percentage width and height responive as "auto" it will make the image responsive.
 An img is an inline element is it will allow a space with paragraphs or text. 
 If you want to remove the space you will use img { display:block} it will wrap down to the next line and move your text.
