All psdedou elements should start with two colons not one.
use  ::marker {

The inline block is hybrid it will help allow you to put some properiteston there that sometime wont let you do.
 IN conclusion...
  inline block do not stack on on each and do not create a new line
  they only take up the wdith of their content. INline block is a hybrid and it will allow you to apply element like block level element do.
  Turning link into bottoms or can be turning a list into a row is a good time to apply it. 


  block level element stack on each other and always create a new line, they have an auto width  of 100 percent of what they have given
